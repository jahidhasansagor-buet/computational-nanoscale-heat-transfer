# Phonon transmission via Atomistic Green’s Function (AGF) — Heterogeneous 1D atomic chain (Fig. 5 & Fig. 7 reproduction)

This repository reproduces the **heterogeneous 1D chain** results (phonon transmission and thermal conductance)
using the **Atomistic Green’s Function (AGF)** method, and validates the implementation against published
results by overlaying digitized reference data.

## Reproduced results
This code reproduces the following figures from the reference paper:

- **Fig. 5:** Phonon transmission 
- **Fig. 7:** Thermal conductance 

## Validation data (digitized from the paper)
The following files contain digitized data points extracted from the paper and are used **only for validation**
(i.e., to check that the code reproduces the published curves):
- `transmission_heterogeneous.txt` → reference points for **Fig. 5**
- `conductance_heterogeneous.txt`  → reference points for **Fig. 7**

## Files
- `phonon_AGF_wo_vacuumgap.ipynb`  
  Main notebook that computes:
  1) transmission on a frequency grid  
  2) conductance by integrating over frequency  
  3) comparison overlays using the paper’s digitized data  
  4) output figure saved as PNG (heterogeneous_conductance_and_transmission.png)
 Output figure generated by the notebook (reproducing **Fig. 5** and **Fig. 7** trends)

## Requirements
Python 3.x and:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
